## expQ2

This software package is based on the R package `expQ` developed by
Chris Sherlock (<https://github.com/ChrisGSherlock/expQ>). It has been
altered for ease of use by reformatting so that it can be easily
installed directly from github or R-universe. The purpose of this
package is to calculate the quantity **v**′mexp(**Q**) where **v** is a
vector of probabilities such that sum(**v**) = 1 and **Q** is a rate
matrix for a continuous-time Markov chain.
